- Edge Node in OnPrem Mode set-up, running and enrolled as described in [ITP/ONP/01/02: Deploy and Enroll Edge Node in OnPrem mode](https://github.com/otcshare/native-on-prem/test/blob/master/itp/onp/ts01-platform-setup.md#itponp0102-deploy-and-enroll-edge-node-in-onprem-mode)
- Consumer and Producer Sample Apps images (docker images build on controller machine using command `make build-docker`[on that path](https://github.com/otcshare/native-on-prem/tree/master/sample-app)) available in Apache HTTP Server

### Test steps

1. Create valid container application in APPLICATIONS tab for
   - Consumer Sample App
   - Producer Sample App
2. Deploy both apps to Edge Node (edit NODE, go to APPS, click DEPLOY APP and select created application)
   - UI: While image is being downloaded, status should be **unknown**
   - UI: After image is downloaded (check node's logs), status should be **deployed** (refresh page/tab)
   - Edge Node: App's container should exist and its status should be Created (`docker ps -a`)
     - look for container with NAME and IMAGE equal to UUID presented on the page)
3. Start the Producer App
   - UI: Refresh node's apps page - for a brief moment, status of the app should be **starting**, and eventually **running**
   - Edge Node: Docker container should be running (`docker ps -a`)
   - Verify logs:
     1. Producer Sample App: verify that following logs are visible
     `The Example Producer eaa.openness  [{ExampleNotification 1.0.0 Description for Event #1 by Example Producer}]}]}`
     `Sending notification`
     2. Stand Alone EAA: verify that following error print is **not** visible
     `Cannot get App ID from EVA`
     3. Appliance EVA logs: verify that **no error** prints are visible
4. Start the Consumer App
   - UI: Refresh node's apps page - for a brief moment, status of the app should be **starting**, and eventually **running**
   - Edge Node: Docker container should be running (docker ps -a)
   - Verify logs:
     1. Producer Sample App: verify that following logs are visible
     `Received notification`
     2. Stand Alone EAA: verify that following error print is **not** visible
     `Cannot get App ID from EVA`
     3. Appliance EVA logs: verify that **no error** prints are visible

        - SourceâIP FilterâMask: 24
        - SourceâIP FilterâBegin Port: 10
        - SourceâIP FilterâEnd Port: 20
        - SourceâIP FilterâProtocol: all
        - TargetâAction: accept

        - Driver: userspace
        - Type: upstream
        - Fallback interface: PCI of the other interface, e.g. 0000:02:00.1
    - Click *SAVE*
5. Click *COMMIT CHANGES*
6. Verify expected outcome after 20-40 seconds
    - UI reports: "Successfully updated node interfaces"
    - NTS container is running
    - Edge DNS is running
    - Configured interface is in /var/lib/appliance/nts/nts.cfg file and values from UI should match values in file
      - name & pci-address = ID in UI
      - description - description in UI
      - traffic-type = IP (because only IP filter was set)
      - traffic-direction = upstream (as set in UI)
      - egress-port = 0 (because there's only 1 port configured)
      - route = prio:99,ue_ip:1.1.1.1/24,ue_port:10-20,encap_proto:noencap
    - Verify that rule is present in NTS:
      - `export NES_SERVER_CONF=/var/lib/appliance/nts/nts.cfg`
      - `cd appliance-ce/internal/nts/client/build`
      - `./nes_client`
      - `Enter command: connect`
      - `Enter command: route list`
      - Verify route list output - two rules should be added with data consistent with created traffic policy, example:

        ```shell
        +-------+------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+-------------+-------------+--------+----------------------+
        | ID    | PRIO       | ENB IP             | EPC IP             | UE IP              | SRV IP             | UE PORT     | SRV PORT    | ENCAP  | Destination          |
